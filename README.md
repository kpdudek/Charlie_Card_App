# Charlie_Card_App

Luckily the MBTA doesnt provide a method of tracking your charlie card's balance. This is my app to track the balance on the card and create some usage statistics.

## What to run it on?

I downloaded [LibTerm](https://develobile.com/libterm/) on IOS. It's a command line interface that is capable of running python 3. Unfortunatley there is no support for git, so you'll have to copy paste from the web.

## Usage

When calling the function, flags are passed to specify the action you want to take.

Run the function with no flags or -h to print the usage.
